Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified the breed of the first dog (Boxer_02.jpg) as "boxer." 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, based on the given information, both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg were classified as "boxer" by all three model architectures. Therefore, they classified the breed of the two dogs to be the same.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg (capybara) and Object_Name_01.jpg (chair) as not being dogs. However,There were misclassifications reported for Capybara_01.jpg, where all three model architectures classified it as "beaver" instead of "capybara." 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Since all three model architectures achieved perfect accuracy in classifying dogs and not-dogs, except for the misclassification of Capybara_01.jpg as "beaver" instead of "capybara". However, based on the total elapsed runtime, it appears that ALEXNET has the shortest runtime among the three model architectures, with a runtime of 0:0:1. VGG has the longest runtime, taking 0:0:7, and RESNET falls in between with a runtime of 0:0:3. If the runtime is a critical factor for selecting the best model architecture, ALEXNET would be the preferred choice
